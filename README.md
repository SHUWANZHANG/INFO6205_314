Problem Description:
In this project, we devote ourselves to solve Traveling Salesman Problem by using Genetic Algorithm. Specifically, a delivery man needs to deliver all of the packages to different places in the city. He has to determine his initial position, and then drives to each customerâ€™s house and, goes back to the starting point. Therefore, our team wants to help him look for the shortest route for visiting every house.
