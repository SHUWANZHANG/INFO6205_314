In this project, we devote ourselves to solving Traveling Salesman Problem by using Genetic Algorithm. Specifically, a delivery man need to deliver all of the packages to different places in the city. He has to determine the initial position, drives to each receiverâ€™s house and then goes back to the starting point. Therefore, our team wants to help him look for the shortest route for saving time and energy.
